<p>This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to get unique integer
identifiers. Typically, plugins use unique integer identifiers in event
messaging. E.g. to unambigously relate event requests and replies in the
<a href="../patch/patch.html">patch</a> extension via
<a href="../patch/patch.html#sequenceNumber">patch:sequenceNumber</a> or to
generally track event instances and their properties accross time.</p>

<p>A feature which is used to get unique integer identifiers. To support this
feature, the host must pass an LV2_Feature to LV2_Descriptor::instantiate() with
